# handcricket
a OpenCV and augmented reality based implementation of python hand cricket
hand cricket is a game which is very much popular to bangladeshi school going people
we tried to make an interactive implementation of this game as our final year project
workflow:
  1.we tried to make the project based on Augmented reality and computervision
  2.but due to lack of library support we could not do that(WE MAKE 2 SEPARATE IMPLEMENTATION BUT INITIAL PLAN WAS TO INTEGRATE BETWEEN THE TWO)
  3.so best we could make is do only one part of our work
  4.here you can find both the augmented part and computer vision part in 2 seperate repo if any can integrate between the two we will be very happy(open for everone in the world to contribute)
  5.this repo contains the COMPUTER VISION IMPLEMENTATION part of the game
